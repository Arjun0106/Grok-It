Developed a mobile application capable of recognizing physical or real-world objects through the mobile camera or images stored in the mobile's storage to provide comprehensive information about the objects present in it. This application has been developed using Kotlin, Firebase and Google's Gemini AI 1.5 Flash API. I created this application to participate in Google's Gemini API Developer Competition.
